     * Determine whether a tile placement is well-formed according to the tests, made in the order:
     * - Test if it's out of bounds.

     * - Test if all three blocks of the tile are on the same height.
     * -   If it is not, return false, else, record the height and continue.
     * - If the tile is placed on height 0, then test if it touches one existing tile.
     * -   This is done by getting all its neighbors' coordinates (only check neighbors that are within bound!),
     * -   and checking if at least one of them has height >= 1
     * -   If yes, return true, else, return false.
     * - If the tile is placed on height h, h >= 1, then test if it touches at least two different tiles below.
     * -   This is done by getting all its coordinates, and checking the pieceField to see if at least two different
     * -   ids are registered in the coordinates.
     * -   If yes, that means this tile straddles two different tiles, thus return true, else, return false.
