 * This is the datastructure that represents the game field. The basic idea is to represent the field's state using
 * three matrices. The first matrix is colorField, which records the color visible at the top of the blocks. The second
 * matrix is heightField, which records the current height of the block. The third matrix is pieceField, which records
 * the id of the piece that is visible at the top of the block. Using these three matrices, it suffices to compute
 * the legal moves at each step, and the scores of each side.
