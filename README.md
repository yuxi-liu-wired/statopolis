# Stratopolis

This is a Java implementation of the boardgame Stratopolis, written for the [COMP1140 course in Australian National University, 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20180514193201/https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2016/course/COMP1140). The assignment started with a code template, upon which I coded the rest.

Implemented in Java and JavaFX.
