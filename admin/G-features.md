In addition to the features that are auto-graded, the graphical user interface
of our project implements the following features:

 - A simple placement viewer (Task 5)
 - A basic playable strato game
 - A basic playable strato game that snaps pieces to the board and checks for validity (Task 8)
 - Heights of regions indicated
 - Running scores of every connected region of both players, ranked by size and height for ease of comparison in case of tie-breaking
 - Basic computer opponent that plays a random move
 - Advanced computer opponent that plays the best move after a 1-ply minimax search
 - Credits and help screen providing the player additional information inside the game
 - Highlighting the previous placed piece
 - Every time the player plays a wrong move, an error message is printed in the gui telling the player why the move is wrong
 - Save and load games (with the save-string encrypted in Base64 to discourage cheating)
 - Going forwards and backwards in game history
 - 3D effects for all tiles! (drawn by Yuxi Liu in GIMP 2.8)
