I declare that the work I have submitted for Stage C of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of using Union-Find algorithm to do the connected component labelling faster, used in class GameField, came from http://aishack.in/tutorials/connected-component-labelling/
  
* The implementation of the Union-Find datastructure is mostly copied from http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/15uf/QuickUnionUF.java.html by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, with reference to https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/AlgsDS07/01UnionFind.pdf, course notes of Algorithms and Data Structures, Fall 2007, MIT, by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

* The idea of sorting a list of SizeHeight by using Comparable interface came from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/order.html, The Javaâ„¢ Tutorials, Oracle Corporation. 

* Two lines of code for String <-> Base64 conversion in methods base64EncryptedGameState and loadBase64EncryptedGameState in Game.java came from http://stackoverflow.com/a/26897706
